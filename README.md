# GraphQL Hooks Example

[GraphQL Hooks](https://github.com/nearform/graphql-hooks) is a library from NearForm that intends to be a minimal hooks-first GraphQL client. Providing a similar API to Apollo.

You'll see this shares the same [graph.cool](https://www.graph.cool) backend as the Apollo example, this is so you can compare the two side by side. The app itself should also look identical.
